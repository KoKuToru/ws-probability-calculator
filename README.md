## Current Limitations

* ignores level-up
* own deck starts with `my_trg = 15` and `my_not_trg = 35`
* own waitingroom starts with `w_my_trg = 0` and `w_my_not_trg = 0`
* opponent waitingroom starts with `w_op_cx = 8 - op_cx` and `w_op_not_cx = 50 - op_cx - op_not_cx`

## Code

right now the following commands are supported:

* `attack DMG`
    * does an attack with trigger check
* `attack cx` / `attack not cx`
    * same as `attack DMG` but does it for each cx or not cx from `attack`, `burn` or `mill`
* `burn DMG`
    * does an attack without trigger check
* `burn cx` / `burn not cx`
    * same as `burn DMG` but does it for each cx or not cx from `attack`, `burn` or `mill`
* `mill COUNT`
    * mill cards from opponent (but it into waiting room)
* `mill cx` / `mill not cx`
    * same as `mill COUNT` but does it for each cx or not cx from `attack`, `burn` or `mill`
* `damage DMG`
    * fix damage to opponent
* `damage cx` / `damage not cx`
    * same as `damage DMG` but does it for each cx or not cx from `attack`, `burn` or `mill`
* `repeat REPEATS`
    * repeats everything that is indented after
* `each cx` / `each not cx`
    * for each cx from `attack`, `burn` or `mill`
* `if cx` / `if not cx`
    * if `attack`, `burn` (`mill`) has a cx (cancel)

everything that is not detected as a command gets ignored, can be used as comment..
